      <h2>Reflection on the Final Project</h2>
        <p>
          This course really helped me understand how to build websites using HTML and CSS. I learned how to make layouts that adjust to different screen sizes and how to organize my content with clear structure. One of the hardest parts for me was figuring out how to make the navigation look good on both phones and computers but after some trial and error I got the hang of it. Testing my site on different browsers and devices taught me how things can look totally different depending on where you view them. It showed me how important it is to check for compatibility. I also learned how to use external CSS and how to place images the right way so they actually load and display the way I want them to across all platforms.

        CSIT 121 has helped me grow more confident in building websites from scratch. I understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create functional and appealing websites. I feel prepared for more future courses, and I'm proud of the progress I’ve made this semester.
