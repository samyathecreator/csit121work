      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This course helped me understand how to build and organize websites using HTML and CSS in a way that actually makes sense. I gained confidence in designing pages that not only look good but also work well on different screen sizes.</p>
      <p>Testing my site on different browsers and devices was eye-opening. It made me realize how something that looks great on one screen might not work the same on another. That process taught me the value of compatibility and why it’s important to design with flexibility in mind.</p>
