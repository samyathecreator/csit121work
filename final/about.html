      <h2>Hi, I’m Samya!</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a full-time student studying Information Technology at the Community College of Baltimore County. I’ve always been interested in tech, and this semester has helped me grow my skills in web development, design, and coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of school, I also work full time. When I’m not in class or working, I enjoy cooking and relaxing. I’ve really enjoyed learning how to make websites this semester even with the trouble I encountered and this portfolio the final projects I'm sharing with you to show what I've learned.\
