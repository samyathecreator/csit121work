      <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
      <p>DIDs are starting to be used in a bunch of areas like digital wallets, healthcare, schools, and more. Like, instead of carrying around a paper diploma, a school could give you a digital one linked to your DID to prove you graduated.</p> 
      <p>Another thing is you could log into websites without needing a password. You’d just use your DID to prove it’s really you. It’s safer and more convenient.</p> 
      <p>Even big companies and the government are looking into using DIDs for stuff like secure voting, travel, and digital ID cards. It’s still relatively new, but it could change a lot in the future.</p>
