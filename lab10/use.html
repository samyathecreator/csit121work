      <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
       <p>DIDs are starting to be used in a lot of areas like digital wallets, healthcare, schools, and more. Instead of carrying around a paper diploma, a school could give you a digital version that's linked to your DID to prove you graduated. This makes things way more convenient, especially if you need to send your diploma to a job or college. Plus, it’s more secure than having it on paper or some random website. Only you decide who can see it which helps protect your info.</p> 

       <p>Another thing is, you could log into websites without needing a password. All you would need is just your DID to prove it’s really you. That means no more forgetting passwords or dealing with reset emails. It’s also a lot safer because your info isn’t stored on every website you visit. Your DID stays private and is verified using tech that keeps everything secure.</p> 

       <p>Even big companies and the government are starting to look into using DIDs for stuff like online voting, travel, and digital ID cards. Imagine going through the airport or voting in an election just by using your phone, no paper ID or long lines. It could make things faster and less stressful. DIDs are still kind of new, but people are working on ways to use them in real life. They could essentially change the way we prove who we are online and in person.</p>
