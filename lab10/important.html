      <h2>Why DIDs Matter</h2>

      <p>Right now, a lot of our online identities are handled by big companies. They’re the ones storing our info and deciding how you log into things, whether it’s your email, social media, or apps. That means your data is in their hands, and if their system gets hacked, your info is at risk. DIDs change that by putting the control back into your hands. You decide what to share and who to share it with, which makes things way more private and secure.</p>

      <p>When someone uses a DID, they don’t have to rely on a company to protect their identity. They’re in charge of their own information and can choose exactly what details to give out and when. That’s a big deal because it flips the way the internet usually works. Instead of companies collecting all your data, you’re the one calling the shots. It’s kind of like taking your online identity off their servers and putting it in your own digital wallet.</p>

      <p>As the internet keeps growing, so do the risks like identity theft, scams, and data leaks. DIDs was made to help fix that by giving people a safer and smarter way to manage their identity. They’re built to last, using tech that keeps your info private without making things harder for you.</p>
