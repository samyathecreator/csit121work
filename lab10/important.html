      <h2>Privacy and Control</h2>
      <p>Big companies control most of our online accounts. They store our info and decide how we log in. But DIDs change that by giving us the power back. This helps protect our privacy and lowers the risk of our data getting leaked.</p> 
      <p>With DIDs, you don’t have to count on a company to keep your info safe. You’re in control of your own identity and only share what’s actually needed. That’s a big change from the usual way things work.</p>
      <p>As the internet keeps growing, issues like hacking and identity theft are going to keep rising. DIDs are meant to solve these problems by making things more secure.</p>
