      <h2>Privacy and Control</h2>
      <p>Right now, most of our digital identities are managed by big companies. They store our information and control how we log in. DIDs change this by giving control back to users, which protects privacy and reduces data breaches.</p>
      <p>When people use DIDs, they don’t have to trust a company to keep their info safe. Instead, they keep their own identity secure and only share what’s needed, when it’s needed. That’s a huge shift in how the internet works today.</p>
      <p>As the internet grows, so do problems like identity theft and hacking. DIDs are designed to fix those problems with a more secure, future-proof system. That’s why they’re becoming more popular in tech communities.</p>
